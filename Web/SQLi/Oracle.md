On Oracle databases, every `SELECT` statement must specify a table to select `FROM`

There is a built-in table on Oracle called `dual`

```sql
SELECT '1' FROM dual
```
# Database version

```bash
SELECT BANNER FROM v$version WHERE ROWNUM = 1
```

# Example

```sql
' union select '1','2' from dual-- -
```
