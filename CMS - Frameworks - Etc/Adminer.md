# Configure MySQL

```bash
sudo apt install default-mysql-server
```

I can start the service with `service mysql start`. The config files are in `/etc/mysql`.

```bash
netstat -antp | grep 3306
```

Change bind-address to tun0 address,

```bash
grep -r 127.0.0.1 /etc/mysql/
/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf:bind-address           = 127.0.0.1
```

```bash
service mysql restart
```
