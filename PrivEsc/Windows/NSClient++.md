NSClient++ (nscp) aims to be a simple yet powerful and flexible monitoring daemon. It was built for Nagios/Icinga/Naemon, but nothing in the daemon is Nagios/Icinga specific and it can and is used in many other scenarios where you want to receive/distribute check metrics. It is entirely possible to use it stand alone as well as the core monitoring system though that is not recommended as it is rather limited.
